##  <p align="center">Welcome to the PI Day Hackathon 

The overall goal of the Hackathon is to collaborate with some new minds and work towards computing 
the most digits of PI that you can. This can be 10 minutes of your time or you can stick around for the full time frame.

To get started send your deloitte email address to Cole Tindall via teams or email("ctindall@deloitte.com"). Then a link will be shared
to a compute/code environment on deepnote that is similar to working with Jupyter Notetbooks.
Within this environment is a preconfigured notebook that has many options for different algorithms commonly used to compute PI. 
With these algorithms feel free to brainstorm new methods or even try to increase the efficiency or accuracy. 

We have 3 Team Leads Hanging around the room or on zoom that we can put you on a team with. Feel free to work independently if desired. 

### 1) Ben Kopchick -- Computer Vision
### 2) Sam Fisher (Zoom) -- NLP
### 3) Kyle O'Connell -- Bioinformatics Data Science

These team leads may have some unique thoughts on ways to help solve PI or be able to introduce side projects to play with while PI is cooking. Just collaborate 
and have fun playing with some code.
